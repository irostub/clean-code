## Introduction

Software engineering principles, from Robert C. Martin"s book Clean Code, adapted for JavaScript & Python. This is not a style guide. It"s a guide to producing readable, reusable, and refactorable software.

Not every principle herein has to be strictly followed, and even fewer will be universally agreed upon. These are guidelines and nothing more, but they are ones codified over many years of collective experience by the authors of Clean Code.

Python Script is Based on JavaScript Version Documents. Targets Python3.7+
